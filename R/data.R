#' Subset of JHU daily state cases and deaths
#'
#' This data source of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths
#' is based on reports made available by the Center for
#' Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
#' This example data ranges from Dec 31, 2020 to Dec 31, 2021,
#' and includes all states.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 20,496 rows and 4 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{geo_value}{the geographic value associated with each row
#'       of measurements.}
#'   \item{time_value}{the time value associated with each row of measurements.}
#'   \item{case_rate}{7-day average signal of number of new
#'       confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, daily}
#'   \item{death_rate}{7-day average signal of number of new confirmed
#'       deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 population, daily}
#' }

#' * \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/jhu-csse.html}{From the COVIDcast Epidata API}:
#'   These signals are taken directly from the JHU CSSE
#'   \href{https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19}{COVID-19 GitHub repository}
#'   without changes. The 7-day average signals are computed by Delphi by
#'   calculating moving averages of the preceding 7 days, so the signal for
#'   June 7 is the average of the underlying data for June 1 through 7,
#'   inclusive.
